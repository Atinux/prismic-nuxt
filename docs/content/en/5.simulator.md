The Simulator acts as a local development environment for your Slices. It previews your Slice components with mock data generated by Slice Machine, allowing you to quickly preview and develop your Slices.

## How Does It Do That?

To enable the Simulator on your website the module has to registers a new `/simulator` route in the Nuxt.js application which is used by Prismic to simulate your Slices within [Slice Machine](https://prismic.io/docs/slice-machine).

## Changing the Simulator Route

You can configure the simulator route by providing another path to the `simulator` key of the module options:

```javascript[nuxt.config.js]
prismic: {
  endpoint: '...',
  simulator: '/my-simulator'
}
```

## Disabling the Simulator

This module comes with simulator enabled by default if `@prismicio/slice-simulator-vue` or `@slicemachine/adapter-nuxt` is installed. If you want to disable the simulator on your website you can set the `simulator` key of the module options to `false`:

```javascript[nuxt.config.js]
prismic: {
  endpoint: '...',
  simulator: false
}
```

The module won't inject anymore Prismic Simulator.

## Customizing the Preview Page

If you want to provide a custom Simulator page, you can do so by creating it at `~/app/prismic/pages/simulator.vue`. Here's its minimum scaffolding:

```vue[simulator.vue]
<template>
  <SliceSimulator v-slot="{ slices }">
    <SliceZone :slices="slices" :components="components" />
  </SliceSimulator>
</template>

<script>
import { SliceSimulator } from '@prismicio/slice-simulator-vue'

// Import your slices here
import { components } from '~/slices'

export default {
  components: {
    SliceSimulator
  },
  data () {
    return { components }
  }
}
</script>
```
