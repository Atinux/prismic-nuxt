*The one where the required Node and NPM versions for `prismic-nuxt` have been dropped down to v8.x.x and v5.x.x respectively...*

<!--truncate-->

We've added backwards compatibility for Node v8 from `prismic-nuxt` v0.5.0 onwards. Node v8 is currently in the "LTS Maintenance" window, so it made sense to support the ageing version until it reaches end of life at the end of 2019. Currently all tests on Travis are passing, so the package should work as expect (obviously no guarantees!). With that said, as Node v8 reach end of life, some of our dependencies may drop support, forcing us to do the same.

Before moving onto v1 of `prismic-nuxt`, we'll reconsider compatability with Node v8. If we do keep it in, we'd likely do a major release at some point in early 2020 to remove support.
