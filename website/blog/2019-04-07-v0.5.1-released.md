*The one where we launched the [official documentation](https://prismic-nuxt.js.org/) site, updated the project README and made the library a little samller...*

<!--truncate-->

Probably not the most exciting release, but it does mark a step forward in the project's maturity. We've now got some official(ish) documentation for `prismic-nuxt`, available at https://prismic-nuxt.js.org. Thanks to the guys over at https://js.org for providing the subdomain and getting it sorted so quickly!

We've updated the project's README to reflect the changes and we've even made the final package a little smaller by excluding unnecessary files.

Focus will now change towards a full v1.0.0 release, with some initial ideas already on our [roadmap](https://github.com/nuxt-community/prismic-nuxt/issues/12). If you have any suggestions or ideas, please add them to our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nuxt-community/prismic-nuxt/issues).
