*The stable version of Nuxt + Prismic finally released!*

<!--truncate-->

This version has some notable changes:

- `prismic-nuxt` has been renamed to `@nuxtjs/prismic`
- Removed `deferLoad` to have it by default + added at the end of `<body>`
- Use and prefers the `prismic` key in `nuxt.config.js` for module options
- Moved `linkResolver` key to its own file: `~/app/prismic/link-resolver.js`, same for `htmlSerializer` (this will become a standard with Nuxt 3)
- When preview mode on, will add `/preview` route + page
- Handles preview mode on statically generated websites ðŸ”¥
- Use the last version of preview mode (with `?repo=...` parameter)
- Import [prismic-vue](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-vue/tree/master/src/components) components (can be customised)
- Update documentation & tests

A demonstration is available on https://github.com/Atinux/nuxt-prismic-showcase
