*The one where you can defer loading the Prismic Toolbar (`prismic.min.js`)...*

<!--truncate-->

Thanks to [@JoepSnijders](https://github.com/JoepSnijders) for suggesting that we add deferred loading for the Prismic Toolbar (`prismic.min.js`). By default the feature is turned off (at least until we're sure that it hasn't broken projects. It may be turned *on* by default for v1), but is easily switched on by tweaking your Nuxt config;

```javascript
modules: [
  ['prismic-nuxt', {
    deferLoad: true
  }]
]
```

By turning on deferred loading, the browser doesn't stop the script from rendering the page (i.e. it becomes non-blocking). In theory this should make the page load a little quicker for users and make it feel more responsive.

The feature is now available in `prismic-nuxt` v0.4.0 and above.
