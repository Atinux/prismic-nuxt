*The one where we patched a few security vulnerabilities...*

<!--truncate-->

Another small release where we've fixed some outstanding security vulnerabilities, primarily in the documentation website. No functional changes were introduced with this version, but there are a few things in the pipeline from contributors that'll be available in v0.6.0.
